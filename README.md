#disastercodefundo

- Finds the best routes available after a natural disaster to better manage natural disasters.
- It assigns scores to various paths based on factors like strength of roads, safety of paths, time taken in traversing the distance between the destinations and then shows the best route available for travel.
- We find the shortest possible route between destinations A and B by minimising the sum of path scores assigned to subpaths between A and B. These scores will be assigned by keeping in mind the various parameters of the road conditions.
- We will use existing map APIs, available road data and live route status provided by various sources.
- Map Interfaces, Github, Azure will be some of the technologies used by us.
